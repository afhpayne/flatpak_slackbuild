### Flatpak for Slackware current

This repo holds slackbuilds for the most current version of ![Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/) as well as current versions of all dependencies.

There are additional dependencies in these slackbuilds that are not part of the out-of-date slackbuilds.org versions.

This flatpak-tree is compatible with my slackgrab.py utility, also available here on git.  This tool will populate each of the slackbuild folders with the appropriate tarballs, and verify the md5sums.

Flatpak is a fantastic upgrade for Slackware, allowing easy sandboxed installation of software that is difficult to install natively in Slackware or horribly out of date.  Examples include libreoffice, nextcloud, steam and so on. See flathub.org for available titles.
