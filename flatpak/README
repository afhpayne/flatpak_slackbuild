Flatpak is a framework for distributing desktop applications
across various Linux distributions. It has been created by
developers who have a long history of working on the Linux
desktop, and is run as an independent open source project.

You can find many apps already available on https://flathub.org/

Allow installs to your whole system:

sudo flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub \
     https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo

Or on a per-user basis:

flatpak --user remote-add --if-not-exists flathub \
     https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
