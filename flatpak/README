Flatpak

Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running
sandboxed desktop applications on Linux.

See https://flatpak.org/ for more information.

Flatpak is available in the package repositories of most
Linux distributions and can be installed from there.

See https://flatpak.org/setup/ for quick setup instructions
for many distributions.

You can find many apps already available on

Note: you can allow installs to your whole system:

sudo flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub \
     https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo

Or on a per-user basis:

flatpak --user remote-add --if-not-exists flathub \
     https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
