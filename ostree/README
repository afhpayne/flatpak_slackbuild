libostree

This project is now known as "libostree", though it is still
appropriate to use the previous name: "OSTree" (or "ostree").
The focus is on projects which use libostree's shared library,
rather than users directly invoking the command line tools
(except for build systems). However, in most of the rest of
the documentation, we will use the term "OSTree", since it's
slightly shorter, and changing all documentation at once is
impractical. We expect to transition to the new name over time.

As implied above, libostree is both a shared library and suite
of command line tools that combines a "git-like" model for
committing and downloading bootable filesystem trees, along
with a layer for deploying them and managing the bootloader
configuration.

The core OSTree model is like git in that it checksums
individual files and has a content-addressed-object store.
It's unlike git in that it "checks out" the files via
hardlinks, and they thus need to be immutable to prevent
corruption. Therefore, another way to think of OSTree is
that it's just a more polished version of Linux VServer
hardlinks.

Features:

    Transactional upgrades and rollback for the system

    Replicating content incrementally over HTTP via GPG
    signatures and "pinned TLS" support

    Support for parallel installing more than just 2
    bootable roots

    Binary history on the server side (and client)

    Introspectable shared library API for build and
    deployment systems

    Flexible support for multiple branches and
    repositories, supporting projects like Flatpak
    which use libostree for applications, rather
    than hosts.
