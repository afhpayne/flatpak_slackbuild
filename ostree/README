libostree is both a shared library and suite of command line
tools that combines a “git-like” model for committing and
downloading bootable filesystem trees, along with a layer for
deploying them and managing the bootloader configuration.

The core OSTree model is like git in that it checksums
individual files and has a content-addressed-object store. It’s
unlike git in that it “checks out” the files via hardlinks, and
they thus need to be immutable to prevent corruption.

Therefore, another way to think of OSTree is that it’s just a
more polished version of Linux VServer hardlinks.

Features:

    Transactional upgrades and rollback for the system

    Replicating content incrementally over HTTP via GPG
    signatures and “pinned TLS” support

    Support for parallel installing more than just 2 bootable
    roots

    Binary history on the server side (and client)

    Introspectable shared library API for build and deployment
    systems

    Flexible support for multiple branches and repositories,
    supporting projects like flatpak which use libostree for
    applications, rather than hosts.
