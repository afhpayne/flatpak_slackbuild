gnome-desktop contains the libgnome-desktop library as well as a data
file that exports the "GNOME" version to the Settings Details panel.

The libgnome-desktop library provides API shared by several applications
on the desktop, but that cannot live in the platform for various
reasons. There is no API or ABI guarantee, although we are doing our
best to provide stability.
