# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

meson: meson (The Meson Build System)
meson:
meson: Meson is an open source build system meant to be both extremely fast,
meson: and, even more importantly, as user friendly as possible.
meson:
meson: The main design point of Meson is that every moment a developer spends
meson: writing or debugging build definitions is a second wasted. So is every
meson: second spent waiting for the build system to actually start compiling
meson: code.
